                            Regression with an Insurance Dataset

    Goal : The objectives of this challenge is to predict insurance premiums based on various factors
    Evaluation: Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) --> metric: RMSLE 

    I - EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
        Objective: Maximise data understanding to define a modelling strategy.
        1 - Shape analysis : 
            # Target identification : Premium Amount
            # Number of rows and columns : (1200000, 21)
            # Variable types : object 11, float64 9, int64 1
            # Identification of missing values : few missing data compared to the size of the dataset and no data groups identified

        2 - Background analysis:
